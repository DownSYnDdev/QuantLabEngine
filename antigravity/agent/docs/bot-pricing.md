# Bot Pricing & Monetization

## Overview
QuantLabEngine supports tenant-managed AlgoBot marketplaces where traders can subscribe to automated trading strategies. Bots execute via webhooks in simulated mode only.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> QuantLab does NOT handle payments. All billing is the tenant's (prop firm's) responsibility.

- Monthly recurring fee paid by trader to tenant.
- Tenant pays platform fee to QuantLab operator (if applicable).

### 3. One-Time Purchase
- Lifetime access to a specific bot version.
- No ongoing support unless separately contracted.

## Implementation Notes
- Pricing configs stored in tenant metadata (not in QuantLab core).
- Tenant's website handles checkout (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
- Bot deployment gated by subscription status check via tenant API.
